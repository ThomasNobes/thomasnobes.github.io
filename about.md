# Hi, I'm Thomas!

 I'm a Ph.D candidate at Monash University, living in Melbourne, Australia. I work on pipe routing, and subsequently  pathfinding in 3D.  You can find a more exhaustive list of my work at [various](/publications) [links](/projects/) [above](/cv/). 

I spend most of my free time trying to create and learn new things. I really like to challenge myself and find great satisfaction in improving my ability in *x, y, z*, regardless of how little application it has to my everyday life.

As such, I dabble in various activities such as; playing video games, learning 3D modelling, playing Go (Baduk), reading fantasy/sci-fi, playing Spikeball, video editing, photoshop memes of my friends, and more. 

As with many, I have absolutely no idea what I want to do in the future, and am open to many possibilities. But nonetheless, I am very excited to get there, and look forward to the journey! If you wish to work with me in the future, please do not hesitate to contact [me](/).
